# Custom Poll Names Feature - User Guide

## 🎯 Overview

You can now **create your own custom poll names** instead of auto-generated ones!

## How It Works

### Before (Automatic)
- System generated: `ram-chate-abc123`
- You had no control over the name

### Now (Custom)
- **You choose the name**: `election-2024`, `favorite-movie`, `best-player`, etc.
- **Your link**: `yourdomain.com/election-2024`

## 📝 Creating a Poll with Custom Name

### Step 1: Fill Poll Question
Enter your poll question as usual.

### Step 2: Enter Poll Name (NEW!)
You'll see a **new field: "Poll Name (URL)"**

Examples of good poll names:
- `election-2024`
- `favorite-movie`
- `best-cricket-player`
- `product-feedback`
- `team-survey`

### Rules for Poll Names:
✅ **Allowed:**
- Letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Hyphens (-)

❌ **Not Allowed:**
- Spaces (automatically converted to hyphens)
- Special characters (@, #, !, etc.)
- Already taken names

### Step 3: Complete the Rest
- Add your options
- Set fake results
- Configure other settings
- Click "Create Poll"

## ✨ Features

### 1. Real-time Preview
As you type, you'll see a preview:
```
This will be your poll link: yourdomain.com/your-poll-name
```

### 2. Auto-formatting
- Spaces → Hyphens
- Uppercase → Lowercase
- Special chars → Removed

**Example:**
- You type: `My Election 2024!`
- Becomes: `my-election-2024`

### 3. Duplicate Detection
If someone already used that name, you'll get an error:
```
❌ This poll name is already taken. Please choose a different name.
```

### 4. Professional Links
Your links now look professional:
```
https://yourdomain.com/election-2024
https://yourdomain.com/customer-feedback
https://yourdomain.com/team-vote
```

## 📋 Examples

| What You Want | What You Type | What You Get |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Election poll | `election-2024` | `yourdomain.com/election-2024` |
| Movie poll | `favorite movie` | `yourdomain.com/favorite-movie` |
| Feedback poll | `product feedback!` | `yourdomain.com/product-feedback` |
| Team poll | `Best Player` | `yourdomain.com/best-player` |

## 🔒 Unique Names

Each poll name must be **unique** across the entire platform.

**Why?**
- Prevents conflicts
- Ensures your link always goes to YOUR poll
- Professional and organized

**What if my name is taken?**
Try variations:
- `election-2024` → `election-2024-final`
- `favorite-movie` → `favorite-movie-dec`
- `team-survey` → `team-survey-2024`

## 🎨 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep it short and memorable
- Use descriptive names
- Include year/month if needed
- Test the link after creating

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use very generic names (like "poll1")
- Make it too long
- Use confusing abbreviations
- Include sensitive information in the link

## 📱 Sharing Your Poll

With custom names, sharing is easier:

**Via Voice:**
"Visit my website dot com slash election 2024"

**Via Text:**
"Please vote at: yourdomain.com/customer-feedback"

**On Social Media:**
Clean, professional links that people trust

## 🛠️ Editing Polls

When you edit an existing poll:
- The poll name is **locked** (shown but not editable)
- This prevents breaking existing links
- All other settings can be changed

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Click "Create Poll"**
2. **Enter Poll Question**: "Who is your favorite cricketer?"
3. **Enter Poll Name**: `favorite-cricketer`
4. **Add Options**: Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Rohit Sharma
5. **Set Fake Results**: 40%, 35%, 25%
6. **Click Create**
7. **Share your link**: `yourdomain.com/favorite-cricketer`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Cannot Change After Creation
Once you create a poll with a name, you **cannot change the name**.

**Why?**
- Links would break
- People who have the old link would get errors
- Maintains stability

### Name Availability
Poll names are **first-come, first-served**.
- Check if your desired name is available
- Pick alternatives if needed
- Be creative!
